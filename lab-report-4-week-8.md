# Lab Report 4 - Additional Testers for markdown-parse
*Author: Matthew Tan*

<br>

Instructions: <br>
For each snippet, add a test both to your implementation of markdown-parse, and the implementation you reviewed in week 7. Run the tests and show the results of running the tests on each. This means you should add a total of 6 test methods (3 to your implementation and 3 to the one you reviewed).

For each test:
1. decide expected behavior
2. show code in tester class for how you turned it into a test
3. corresponding output (show pass/fail output)

<!-- end of the list -->

## Reflection

Answer with 2-3 sentences each:
Is there small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet (1)(2)(3) and all related cases that use inline code with (1)backticks, (2)nested parentheses/brackets/escaped brackets, (3)new lines in brackets/parentheses? If yes, describe code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
